# RECOMMENDED ARMORSETS CONFIGURATION
# Copy this to plugins/ArmorSets/config.yml as a starting point

# ============================================================================
# GENERAL SETTINGS
# ============================================================================
settings:
  # Enable console debug messages
  # Helpful for troubleshooting issues
  debug: false

  # How often to re-check static effects (in ticks, 20 = 1 second)
  # Lower = more responsive, higher = less CPU usage
  # Recommended: 20 (1 second)
  effect-check-interval: 20

  # Enable ItemsAdder integration for custom items
  # Only set to true if ItemsAdder is installed
  use-itemsadder: false

# ============================================================================
# CORE FUNCTION SETTINGS (Socketable Abilities)
# ============================================================================
core-functions:
  # Can players give/trade function shards to each other?
  allow-trading: true

  # Can players extract functions from armor (unsocket them)?
  allow-extraction: true

  # Cost to extract a function (currency or items)
  # Set to 0 for free extraction
  extraction-cost: 0

  # Enforce tier restrictions
  # If true: Tier I armor can only hold Tier I functions
  # If false: Any tier function can go in any armor (more freedom)
  enforce-tier-restrictions: false

  # Enforce slot restrictions
  # If true: Helmet functions ONLY go in helmets
  # Usually should be true
  enforce-slot-restrictions: true

# ============================================================================
# ARMOR SET DETECTION SETTINGS
# ============================================================================
sets:
  # How to detect if player is wearing a set
  # NAME_PATTERN: Check if all pieces match a regex pattern (recommended)
  # LORE_TAG: Check if armor has specific lore text
  # NBT_TAG: Check NBT data on items
  detection-method: NAME_PATTERN

  # Should all 4 pieces be the same tier?
  # If true: Must wear 4/4 same tier for set bonus (Arcanist T1 + T2 mixed doesn't work)
  # If false: Can mix tiers and still get bonus (more flexible)
  require-same-tier: true

  # Enable partial set bonuses
  # Let players get bonuses with 2-3 pieces instead of full 4
  partial-bonuses:
    enabled: false
    2-piece-multiplier: 0.25   # 25% of full set bonus
    3-piece-multiplier: 0.5    # 50% of full set bonus

# ============================================================================
# GUI SETTINGS (Socket Interface)
# ============================================================================
gui:
  # Title when opening socket GUI
  socket-title: "&8Socket Core Function"

  # Title for function storage GUI
  storage-title: "&8Core Function Storage"

  # Sounds for GUI interactions
  sounds:
    open: BLOCK_CHEST_OPEN
    close: BLOCK_CHEST_CLOSE
    socket: BLOCK_ANVIL_USE
    unsocket: BLOCK_ANVIL_LAND
    error: ENTITY_VILLAGER_NO

# ============================================================================
# COOLDOWN SETTINGS
# ============================================================================
cooldowns:
  # Global cooldown between ability activations (in ticks)
  # 10 ticks = 0.5 seconds
  # 20 ticks = 1 second
  # 0 = no global cooldown
  global-cooldown: 0

  # Show messages when abilities are on cooldown?
  show-cooldown-messages: true

  # Message format when ability is on cooldown
  # %ability% = ability name
  # %remaining% = seconds remaining
  cooldown-message: "&c%ability% is on cooldown! (%remaining%s remaining)"

# ============================================================================
# EFFECT CAPS & LIMITS (Balance Settings)
# ============================================================================
effects:
  # Maximum damage increase from effects (percentage)
  # If set to 500, effects can boost damage up to 500% max
  # Prevents any one effect from being too overpowered
  # Set higher if you want more powerful abilities
  max-damage-increase: 500

  # Maximum teleport distance for teleport effects (blocks)
  max-teleport-distance: 50

  # Maximum entities that can be spawned per effect
  # Prevents lag from too many mobs spawning
  max-spawned-entities: 5

  # Maximum lifesteal percentage
  # If set to 50, max healing is 50% of damage dealt
  max-lifesteal: 50

# ============================================================================
# INTEGRATION SETTINGS (Third-Party Plugins)
# ============================================================================
integrations:
  # PlaceholderAPI support for messages
  # Enables %player_name%, %player_health%, etc in messages
  placeholderapi: true

  # WorldGuard region checks
  # Effects won't trigger in certain WorldGuard regions
  worldguard: true

  # Respect WorldGuard PvP flags
  # Effects won't trigger in no-PvP regions
  respect-pvp-flags: true

# ============================================================================
# RECOMMENDED ADJUSTMENTS BY SERVER TYPE:
# ============================================================================
#
# PVE SERVER (Cooperative/Monster Hunting):
#   - Increase max-damage-increase to 800+ (stronger abilities)
#   - Decrease effect-check-interval to 10 (more responsive)
#   - Enable partial-bonuses for more progression
#   - Lower cooldowns in your set configs
#
# PVP SERVER (Combat-Focused):
#   - Keep max-damage-increase at 300-500 (balanced)
#   - Keep cooldowns longer (5-10 seconds)
#   - Enable require-same-tier: true (prevents min-maxing)
#   - Lower max-lifesteal to 25-30 (less healing)
#
# CASUAL SERVER (Fun Gamemode):
#   - Increase max-damage-increase to 1000+ (crazy powerful)
#   - Lower cooldowns (1-2 seconds)
#   - Enable partial-bonuses (easier to get bonuses)
#   - Show cooldown-messages: true (more feedback)
#
# PERFORMANCE-CRITICAL:
#   - Increase effect-check-interval to 40 (checks less often)
#   - Disable placeholderapi if not needed
#   - Disable worldguard if not needed
#   - Use fewer, simpler effects
#   - Lower max-spawned-entities to 2-3
#
# ============================================================================
# DEBUG CONFIGURATION (Advanced)
# ============================================================================
#
# To debug issues, enable debug mode:
#   1. Set "debug: true" above
#   2. Restart server
#   3. Check console for detailed messages
#   4. Look for [ArmorSets] log messages
#   5. Check specific effect triggers
#
# Common Debug Messages:
#   - "Loaded 42 armor sets" - Sets loaded successfully
#   - "Loaded 156 core functions" - Functions loaded successfully
#   - "Armor set detected: arcanist_t1" - Set detection working
#   - "Effect triggered: INCREASE_DAMAGE" - Effect executed
#   - "Cooldown active for player" - Cooldown preventing trigger
#
# ============================================================================
# TESTING COMMANDS:
# ============================================================================
#
# Give yourself a full armor set:
#   /as give @s set arcanist_t1
#
# Give a function shard:
#   /as give @s function night_sight
#
# Check held armor info:
#   /as info
#
# Remove function from armor:
#   /as unsocket
#
# Reload all configs (after making changes):
#   /as reload
#
# Check performance:
#   /as perf
#
# ============================================================================
# NOTES:
# ============================================================================
#
# 1. Always test new settings before putting on live server
# 2. Start conservative with cooldowns and chances
# 3. Gather player feedback and adjust as needed
# 4. Use /as reload to test changes without restarting
# 5. Monitor server performance with /as perf
# 6. Enable debug mode when troubleshooting
# 7. Keep backups of working config files
