          trigger: ATTACK
          chance: 50        # Much higher trigger rate

            - "POTION:INVISIBILITY:2 @Self" # Gain invisibility too
            - "MESSAGE:&5You become one with darkness!"

# Tips:
# 1. name_pattern uses regex:
#    - "Shadow.*" matches anything starting with Shadow
#    - "^Shadow Helmet$" matches exactly "Shadow Helmet"
#    - "(?i)shadow" matches Shadow (case-insensitive)
#
# 2. Effect values should increase from tier to tier:
#    - Tier I: 30% chance, +30% damage
#    - Tier II: 50% chance, +75% damage
#    - Tier III: 75% chance, +150% damage
#
# 3. Cooldowns should decrease at higher tiers:
#    - Tier I: 8 second cooldown
#    - Tier II: 5 second cooldown
#    - Tier III: 2 second cooldown
#
# 4. Always include EFFECT_STATIC for passive bonuses (helmet night vision, etc)
#
# 5. Messages support color codes:
#    - &0-&f for basic colors
#    - &#RRGGBB for hex colors
#    - <gradient:#color1:#color2>text</gradient> for gradients
