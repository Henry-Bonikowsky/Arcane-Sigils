1.8 PvP on 1.21
---------------

0:59

EX feature of modern MMC which is that

1:01

they were able to completely recreate

1:03

1.8 Combat on 1.21 and when I say that

1:06

I'm not simply talking about disabling

1:08

the attack cool down they made PVP on

1:10

1.21 one to one with their 1.8 server I

1:13

mean just look at some of these fights

1:15

it's virtually identical to 1.8 since

1:17

there's a lot that's going on behind the

1:18

scenes Let me give you a quick rundown

1:20

of how this all works first of all a

1:22

recent change in 1.2.2 made it so you

1:25

can add the consumable attribute to

1:26

items letting you effectively eat any

1:28

item in the game by adding the

1:30

consumable attribute to a sword and

1:32

giving it a nearly infinite consume

1:33

duration this lets you get sword

1:35

blocking back on 1.21 the damage

1:37

reduction from blocking is done server

1:39

sided and with that sword blocking now

1:41

works exactly the same as how it does on

1:43

1.8 everything else like knockback

1:45

saturation projectile physics hit

1:47

registration and hitbox sizes are one to

1:50

one with mmc's 1.8 server even Rod

1:52

tricking Works which is a strat that 1.8

1:54

players use to deal extra damage with

1:56

their rod the only thing that's

1:57

different are the animations but thanks

1:59

to mod called animum you can have all

2:01

the 1.8 animations back on 1.21 this mod

2:05

works with any fabric based launcher

2:06

like lunar and feather Cline for example

2:08

and it can be toggled on and off with

2:10

just a command so there should be no

2:11

problems dropping it into your existing

2:13

1.21 mods folder just to reiterate all

2:16

the changes within anim mium are visual

2:18

changes and don't affect Gameplay at all

2:20

so you don't need to use the mod to play

2:21

Legacy PVP on 1.21 thanks to all these

2:24

changes Legacy PVP on mmc's 1.21 server

2:27

feels indistinguishable from their 1.8

2:30

server and it's actually magical all of

2:32

the 1.8 related changes can be toggled

2:34

on and off within mmc's Custom kit

2:35

settings and you can even merge aspects

2:37

of 1.8 and 1.20 combat together for

2:40

example you can have 1.20 UHC with 1.8

2:42

rods or you can have 1.8 Fireball fight

2:45

using a 1.9 mace right now you can only

2:47

make 1.8 game modes within mmc's Custom

2:50

kit editor but in the future they plan

2:51

to have both 1.8 and 1.20 gamees that

2:54

anyone can queue into so regardless of

2:56

what your preferred combat version is

2:58

both communities can coexist with each

2:59

other on Modern MMC it's actually

3:01

mind-blowing that MMC was able to pull

3:03

all of this off and I genuinely think

3:05

the server will finally make 1.8

3:08

obsolete but that's not all modern MMC

3:10

has also fixed some of the biggest

3:12

problems with 1.20 combat as well but

3:14

before I tell you about that let me tell

3:16

you about the sponsor of today's video
Lunar Client Sponsor
--------------------

3:18

Lunar client this video was brought to

3:20

you by lunar client the number one free

3:21

client for Minecraft to enhance your

3:23

gaming experience lunar client has over

3:25

70 mods and hundreds of customizable

3:28

settings to help you tailor your mind

3:29

craft experience exactly to your needs

3:32

for example one of my favorite features

3:33

is the ability to host your own

3:35

multiplayer World for free directly

3:37

within lunar client without having to

3:38

pay for your own Minecraft server it's

3:40

so easy too and only takes like two

3:42

clicks to get your own SMP going lunar

3:44

clients performance optimizations ensure

3:46

that you have the most FPS possible

3:48

which is crucial for me when I'm playing

3:49

on larger multiplayer servers lunar

3:51

client also has hundreds of in-game

3:53

Cosmetics to spice up your in-game

3:55

appearance including exclusive content

3:57

creator Cosmetics like my Year of the

3:58

Dragon cloaks if any of this sounds

4:00

appealing to you then make sure to try

4:02

out lunar client for free at the link in

4:03

the description when it comes to block
Block Fixes
-----------

4:06

placements something that you might have

4:07

noticed on other servers is that when

4:09

you place blocks from your offhand

4:10

sometimes they disappear you can see

4:12

this clearly when I try to drag click

4:13

with blocks in my offhand most of them

4:15

end up disappearing after I punch them

4:17

this makes bridging with blocks in your

4:19

offhand extremely infuriating in game

4:21

modes like sky battle since your blocks

4:23

will randomly disappear below your feet

4:24

and send you falling to your death on

4:26

Modern MMC though this issue is

4:28

completely fixed it's basically

4:30

impossible to make my blocks disappear

4:32

even when I'm drag clicking as fast as I

4:33

can because of this you can even do

4:35

things like teley bridging with blocks

4:37

in your offhand without any ghost blocks

4:39

at all another thing you may have

4:40

noticed on 1.20 servers is that when you

4:42

place a block with your offhand and try

4:44

to attack immediately after you'll get a

4:46

weak hit instead of a fully charged

4:47

attack this isn't shown by your attack

4:49

indicator either which is extremely

4:51

unintuitive for any game mode involving

4:53

Block PvP on 1.20 as it turns out it's

4:56

actually the swing animation that resets

4:58

your attack cool down instead of you

4:59

left clicking with your weapon since

5:01

placing a block with your offhand causes

5:03

your offhand to swing that is what

5:05

resets your attack cool down this

5:06

doesn't just happen with your blocks

5:08

either anything that causes a swing

5:09

animation like pressing a button opening

5:11

a door or throwing a snowball will cause

5:14

your attack cool down to reset without

5:16

visually showing it with your attack

5:17

indicator I have no idea why this is a

5:20

thing but it makes Block PvP feel so

5:22

much more clunky on 1.20 servers

5:24

compared to 1.8 servers on Modern MMC

5:26

however your attack cooldown is only

5:28

reset when you actually use your weapon

5:30

because of this block trapping Works

5:32

seamlessly on Modern MMC and you no

5:34

longer have to wait for your attack cool

5:35

down to reset after placing blocks from

5:37

your offhand next up on the list are
Crystal Speed Fix
-----------------

5:40

crystals if you've ever tried Crystal

5:41

PVP before you know that you can Crystal

5:43

much faster on low ping compared to high

5:46

ping the reason this happens is simply

5:48

because of how entity interactions work

5:50

in Minecraft when you place an entity

5:52

like a crystal on a piece of obsidian

5:54

you have to wait for the server to

5:55

register your input before you can

5:57

explode the crystal the same goes for

5:58

exploding Crystal crystals you have to

6:00

wait for the server to register the

6:01

explosion before you can place another

6:03

Crystal on the same block because of

6:05

this the higher your latency is the

6:07

slower your Crystal speeds are this is

6:09

terrible for hyping players and

6:10

essentially Cuts their DPS in half in

6:12

any game mode that utilizes Crystal

6:14

explosions like vanilla smps for example

6:17

thanks Mo Mojang but thankfully MMC has

6:19

found a way to fix this issue on Modern

6:21

MMC you can Crystal as fast as you want

6:23

regardless of how high your latency is

6:26

this is all done server side too so you

6:27

don't need to download any mods to be

6:29

able ble to Crystal as fast as a low

6:31

pain player the last and probably one of
Knockback Fix
-------------

6:33

the biggest optimizations on Modern MMC

6:36

is fixing Minecraft's knockback modern

6:38

MMC uses a plugin called Club sync which

6:41

is basically mmc's version of knockback

6:43

sync if you don't know what knockback

6:45

sync is I made an entire video

6:46

explaining it in detail but let me give

6:48

you a quick recap if you're playing on a

6:50

vanilla server your knockback will

6:52

actually change depending on what your

6:53

ping is if you have higher ping you'll

6:56

actually take less knockback because of

6:58

this it's pretty much impossible B to

6:59

hold High ping players in a combo on

7:01

1.20 which is a huge problem for pretty

7:04

much every melee based game mod I mean

7:06

imagine if having higher ping made you

7:07

move Less in games like Super Smash Bros

7:10

Club sync is a plugin that adds roll

7:12

back net code to Minecraft's knockback

7:13

this makes it so that every player takes

7:15

the same knockback that a low ping

7:17

player would take on a vanilla server

7:19

without changing Minecraft's knockback

7:20

mechanics at all because of this on

7:22

Modern MMC every player can be comboed

7:25

regardless of what their ping is in

7:26

contrast to vanilla servers where only

7:28

low ping players can be comboed since my

7:30

video on knockback sync the plugin has

7:32

absolutely blown up and is now being

7:34

used by some of the biggest competitive

7:36

1.20 PVP servers it's even been approved

7:38

by the official Minecraft tier list

7:40

mmc's version of it does feel the most

7:42

consistent however but that shouldn't

7:44

really be a surprise since they were the

7:45

ones to invent this plugin in the first

7:47

place and let me tell you it feels

7:49

fantastic to PvP with it literally feels

7:52

the exact same as vanilla knockback but

7:54

now I can actually hold High ping

7:55

players and combos easily one of the

7:58

biggest improvements to 1. 20 PVP and I

8:00

highly recommend trying it as someone
Conclusion
----------

8:03

that's been involved in the multiplayer

8:05

Community for over a decade I can easily

8:07

say that modern MMC is the most

8:09

Innovative PVP server that's ever been

8:11

released not only have they managed to

8:14

finally unite the 1.8 and 1.20 player

8:16

bases but they've also fixed every major

8:18

problem that multiplayer servers on the

8:20

latest version have been experiencing

8:22

for years not only that but modern MMC

8:24

has also shown interest in having the

8:26

best server performance and anti-che out

8:28

of any 1.20 server which is awesome to

8:30

see since this is an area that most 1.20

8:33

servers struggle in keep in mind though

8:34

that while modern MMC is now public for

8:36

anyone to play it is still in beta so

8:39

try to keep your expectations in check

8:40

for now until the server fully releases

8:43

but with that being said I genuinely

8:44

believe that the release of modern MNC

8:46

will start a new era for competitive

8:48

Minecraft combat and I really hope that

8:50

more servers will follow their footsteps

8:52

going forward to change the game for the

8:54

better
